# Bhejane Trading Store Database Normalization Project

Welcome to the Bhejane Trading Store Database Normalization Project! In this project, you'll be diving into the world of SQL and applying your ninja skills to transform a denormalized database into a sleek, efficient system.

## Project Overview

Bhejane Trading Store is an online retailer specializing in Covid essential items. The current struggle lies in managing the inventory system, and you've been enlisted as a consultant to solve this challenge.

## Mission Brief

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. **Denormalized Database:** You will receive a denormalized database with two tables.
   
2. **Normalization Task:** Your primary task is to normalize the database into the third normal form (3NF). Refer to the attached Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) as your guide on creating the necessary tables.

3. **MCQ Test:** After normalization, complete the multiple-choice questions (MCQ) test under the 'Predict' tab of Athena to validate your understanding.

4. **Client Use-Cases:** Throughout the normalization process, consider and address client (Bhejane Trading) use-cases for the database.

5. **Data Anomalies:** Identify and rectify data anomalies in SQL, ensuring a consistent and reliable database structure.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to embark on your database normalization journey:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
2. Review the provided denormalized database and ERD.

3. Begin the normalization process, creating tables according to the guidelines in the ERD.

4. After normalization, complete the MCQ test to reinforce your understanding.

5. Acknowledge and address client use-cases during the normalization.

6. Identify and resolve data anomalies to enhance the integrity of the SQL database.

## Folder Structure

- **/docs:** Contains documentation files, including the ERD and any additional reference materials.
